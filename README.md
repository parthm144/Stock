# Stock Price Prediction using Time Series

This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to use time series analysis to predict stock prices. The project uses Python and various libraries for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

---

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Prepares and loads stock price data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes trends, seasonality, and other characteristics of the dataset.
- **Time Series Modeling**: Implements models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM to forecast stock prices.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of the data and predictions.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended IDE: Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `statsmodels`
  - `tensorflow` (for deep learning models)

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Price_Prediction_using_Time_series.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess data.
   - Explore trends and patterns.
   - Train and test predictive models.
   - Visualize predictions.

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Plotting stock price trends over time.
   - Identifying seasonality and trends using statistical techniques.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM.
   - Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE or MAE.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Actual vs. predicted stock prices.
   - Residual analysis.

## Results

- Provides insights into the stock market trends and price predictions.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of time series models for financial forecasting.
